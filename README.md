Welcome to TransmuteIt, my 2nd plugin!

## Lore

This plugin is inspired by ProjectE's transmutation tablet. I'm a big fan of the EMC system, and how you actually need to transmute the item to be able to transmute more of it. This is essentially just the tablet (as a command). No stone or anything. You can customize each EMC value and all that.

The design is to mimic it as much as possible, as a result:

1) You need to transmute an item to be able to transmute it.

2) Items have an "EMC" Value, in order to transmute one, you need enough EMC for it.

## Discrepancies from ProjectE

* EMC calculations aren't smart. You can't just set the EMC value for a gold ingot and expect it to auto-calculate gold blocks being ingot times 9. I'm sure it's possible, but I really don't want to spend the time.
* It's just the transmuting, as long as you have the perms, you can transmute. No tablet, no blocks, just commands.
* As of now, there's no "Tome of Knowledge" to unlock all the discoveries, maybe I'll add a perm for that.
* Potions/Enchanted Books or other items that rely on metadata aren't tracked either. Only names so far.
* EMC is limited to a Java int (2.1 billion), however if economy is enabled, it is limited to the Vault maximum.

## Paper versus Spigot

This plugin is compiled against and tested with [Paper](https://papermc.io).
While it is compatible with Spigot, there may be some features that are missing.
You may run into `NoSuchMethodError`s, or other issues.
While you can report these, and they will be fixed, it's recommended to just use Paper to avoid any errors altogether.

Current missing features:
* Spigot doesn't have a `getRarity()` function on their `Enchantment` class, so enchantments are not calculated into the EMC value.
